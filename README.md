## Introduction

Welcome to the HSL Color Picker project! This Node.js project allows users to interactively pick colors using a rainbow bar and displays different hues of the chosen color in separate boxes. While the project is currently under development, the goal is to eventually display the selected HSL color in text format for each of these boxes and the main page.

## Features

- Click on the rainbow bar to set the background color of the web page.
- Four individual boxes display different hues of the selected color.
- Future feature: Display the HSL color in text format for each box and the main page.
